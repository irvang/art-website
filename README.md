# art-website
## Responsive website using HTML and CSS.
#### Created for CodeSquad on March, 2018.


The Art Website is a project I developed for CodeSquad boot camp. The goal of this project is to create a responsive page using HTML and CSS. I chose flexbox for the responsiveness, since it suited my needs.

The website follows semantic principles using the section, article, nav, and footer tags. You can see the outline of the document by clicking "Click here for displaying the table of contents!" link at the bottom of the page.
